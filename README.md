# Welcome to Vert.x on CloudBees

This is a "ClickStart" that gets you going with a Gradle - Vert.x 2"seed" project starting point. You can launch it here:

<a href="https://grandcentral.cloudbees.com/?CB_clickstart=https://raw.github.com/CloudBees-community/tomcat7-maven-clickstart/master/clickstart.json"><img src="https://d3ko533tu1ozfq.cloudfront.net/clickstart/deployInstantly.png"/></a>

This will setup a continuous deployment pipeline - a CloudBees Git repository, a Jenkins build compiling and running the test suite (on each commit).
Should the build succeed, this seed app is deployed on a Tomcat 7 container.
